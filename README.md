# DokiBot

What started out as a fun gag with friends to keep track of so-called 'poems' has developed into a full-fledged Discord bot! If you enjoyed the hit game Doki Doki Literature Club, this bot is for you. It has been mostly used as a valuable learning experience for me, but feel free to add the bot to your server if any of these features interest you.

## Features
### Doki-Poems
Make a channel called doki-poems and DokiBot will grab the first word said every minute/hour/day (customizable).
 
### Insults
Randomly throughout the day, DokiBot will mention someone and have a special message for them.

### Other Features
There are a bunch of other small Easter eggs that will be implemented as DokiBot's development continues.

### -help \[\<command\>\]
